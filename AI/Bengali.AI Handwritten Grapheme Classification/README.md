# Bengali AI Handwritten Grapheme Classification
> 이유한님의 유튜브를 보면서 공부한 내용들을 정리

## Overview
Bengali is the 5th most spoken language in the world with hundreds of million of speakers. It’s the official language of Bangladesh and the second most spoken language in India. Considering its reach, there’s significant business and educational interest in developing AI that can optically recognize images of the language handwritten. This challenge hopes to improve on approaches to Bengali recognition.

Optical character recognition is particularly challenging for Bengali. While Bengali has 49 letters (to be more specific 11 vowels and 38 consonants) in its alphabet, there are also 18 potential diacritics, or accents. This means that there are many more graphemes, or the smallest units in a written language. The added complexity results in ~13,000 different grapheme variations (compared to English’s 250 graphemic units).

For this competition, you’re given the image of a handwritten Bengali grapheme and are challenged to separately classify three constituent elements in the image: grapheme root, vowel diacritics, and consonant diacritics.

By participating in the competition, you’ll hopefully accelerate Bengali handwritten optical character recognition research and help enable the digitalization of educational resources. Moreover, the methods introduced in the competition will also empower cousin languages in the Indian subcontinent.
